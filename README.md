![segformer_architecture](images/segformer_architecture.png)

Python, Transformers, ResNet-50

• Implemented Segformers, integrating Efficient Self-Attention, Mix-FFN, Overlap Patch embedding, and Dice loss

• Used the 3k images from imbalanced BDD 100K dataset to achieve a Mean Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 77.07%

## Result
